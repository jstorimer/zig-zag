      Gameplay
      =========
        Due to the barometric pressure in the cave
      your ship is constantly falling. You must 
      continuallyrise up to avoid crashing on the 
      cave floor.
        Zig Zag Cave is known for its floating rocks. 
      The brown colored ones are dangerous and will 
      harm your ship.

      =================
        The colored blocks however will stick to the
      hull of your ship. These ones will protect you,
      push it against a brown rock and it will ensure
      your safety.
        But watch out for them in numbers. A wall of colored
      blocks is just as impenetrable as a brown one.
        If you ever get in a bind you can always just 
      turn on your safety flames and ride to safety.
