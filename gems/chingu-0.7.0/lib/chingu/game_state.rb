module Chingu
  #
  # Chingu incorporates a basic push/pop game state system (as discussed here: http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=477320).
  # Game states is a way of organizing your intros, menus, levels.
  # Game states aren't complicated. In Chingu a GameState is a class that behaves mostly like your default Gosu::Window (or in our case Chingu::Window) game loop.
  #
  # # A simple GameState-example
  # class Intro < Chingu::GameState
  #   def update
  #     # game logic here
  #   end
  #
  #   def draw
  #     # screen manipulation here
  #   end
  #        
  #   # Called when we enter the game state
  #   def setup
  #     @player.angle = 0   # point player upwards
  #   end
  #    
  #   # Called when we leave the current game state
  #   def finalize
  #     push_game_state(Menu)   # switch to game state "Menu"
  #   end
  # end
