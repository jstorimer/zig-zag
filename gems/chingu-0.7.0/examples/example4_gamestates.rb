#
# Example demonstrating jumping between 4 different game states.
#
# push_game_state, pop_game_state, current_game_state previous_game_state are 4 helper-methods that Chingu mixes in
# into Chingu::Window and Chingu::GameState
#
# Behind the scenes they work against @game_state_manager that's autocreated within Chingu::Window.
#
# Execution in example4 flows like this:
#
# 1) Core Gosu calls instancemethods draw / update in the class based on Gosu::Window
#    In this example 'Game' since "Game < Chingu::Window" and "Chingu::Window < Gosu::Window"
# 
# 2) In its turn Game (Chingu::Window) calls @game_state_manager.draw / update
#
# 3) @game_state_manager calls draw / update on the current active game state
#
# 4) Each game state keeps a collection @game_objects which it calls draw / update on.
#    Any object based on Chingu::GameObject (In this example Player and Text) automatically
#    gets added to the correct state or or main window.
#

#
# Our standard Chingu::Window that makes all the magic happen.
